# 100 Days of Python - Progress and Lessons

This repository documents my progress from the "100 Days of Python" course by Angela Yu on Udemy. Below are the lessons Iâ€™ve learned :

## Day 1: Beginner - Printing, Commenting, Debugging, and String Manipulation
- Learned how to print output using `print()`.
- Understood how to add comments in Python using `#`.
- Debugged basic errors in code.
- Practiced string manipulation techniques.

## Day 2: Beginner - Variables, Data Types, and String Manipulation
- Worked with variables and understood their importance in Python.
- Explored data types (int, float, string, boolean).
- Performed advanced string manipulations using `f-strings`.

## Day 3: Beginner - Control Flow and Logical Operators
- Implemented if-else statements to control program flow.
- Learned about comparison and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).
- Solved challenges involving decision-making processes.

## Day 4: Beginner - Randomization and Python Lists
- Generated random numbers using the `random` module.
- Worked with lists for storing and manipulating collections of data.
- Created simple programs like rock-paper-scissors.

## Day 5: Beginner - Loops
- Utilized `for` loops to iterate over sequences.
- Learned about the `range()` function.
- Wrote programs using loops to process data efficiently.

## Day 6: Beginner - Functions and Code Blocks
- Defined and used functions for code modularity.
- Understood the importance of indentation in Python.
- Practiced writing reusable functions.

## Day 7: Beginner - Hangman Game
- Built a word-guessing game, Hangman.
- Worked with lists and conditional statements.
- Understood how to design a program with multiple steps.

## Day 8: Beginner - Function Parameters and Caesar Cipher
- Added parameters to functions.
- Built a Caesar Cipher program for encoding and decoding text.
- Explored modular design in Python programs.

## Day 9: Beginner - Dictionaries and Nesting
- Created and used dictionaries for key-value data storage.
- Practiced nesting lists and dictionaries for hierarchical data.
- Developed a program for managing data efficiently.

## Day 10: Beginner - Functions with Outputs
- Learned how to return values from functions.
- Practiced writing functions that perform calculations and return results.
- Explored code readability and design.

## Day 11: Beginner - Blackjack Game
- Built a simplified version of the Blackjack game.
- Worked with loops, conditions, and randomization.
- Improved problem-solving by breaking the game into smaller components.

## Day 12: Beginner - Scope and Namespaces
- Understood variable scope (local and global).
- Explored how namespaces work in Python.
- Debugged issues related to variable scope.

## Day 13: Beginner - Debugging Techniques
- Practiced debugging using print statements and error messages.
- Explored common programming errors and their solutions.
- Improved logical thinking to solve code issues.

## Day 14: Beginner - Higher Order Functions and Python Decorators
- Learned about higher-order functions.
- Implemented simple Python decorators for enhancing functions.
- Understood the concept of passing functions as arguments.

## Day 15: Beginner - Coffee Machine Project
- Built a coffee machine simulator.
- Applied knowledge of functions, dictionaries, and loops.
- Improved understanding of how to structure larger programs.
